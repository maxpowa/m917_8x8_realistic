MACK Defense M917A3 Realistic Behavior for SnowRunner
=====

Inspired by the tweaks provided in the Pacific P512PF 6x4 // 6x6 Realistic Behavior mod - I was playing through the game with that mod and enjoyed the experience of a more realistic transmission (even though the game doesn't really simulate transmissions very well).

Changes (M917A3 is based on Mack Granite chassis, so the options available for that truck are available here):

 -Replaced stock engines with real-life counterparts (Mack MP7/MP8/MP8+ 171k-253k \[1710-2531Nm\] tq)
 - Replaced stock transmissions with real-life counterparts, calculated ratios assuming low gear transfer case (Allison 6spd, Fuller 13spd, Mack mDrive 12/13spds)
 - Replaced stock suspensions with real-life counterparts (Hendrickson PRIMAAX 31k/35k, active only since real truck has air suspension, tuned to roughly feel right)
 - Renamed stock tires to real-life counterparts, and made other medium truck tire options available (Michelin XZY3, base game medium truck tires)
 - Replaced winch options (18m/1.3str online)
 - Renamed diff lock (Meritor DCDL)
 - Added F750's cabin protector addon, compatible with addons that make sense (where's the dump body addon!?)

This truck should not be OP... It might actually still kinda suck. It should always have plenty of low end power thanks to the gearing of the transmissions/axle planetary gears
